I have created contact app clone by using UI/UX....<BR>
    A contact app clone using UI/UX principles involves<br> designing and developing an intuitive interface where users can view, add, edit, and manage their contacts. Here’s a brief breakdown of how the project can be structured:

Contact List Screen: Displays a searchable, scrollable list<br> of contacts with key details like name, photo, and phone number.
Add/Edit Contact Screen: Includes input fields for adding new<br> contact details (name, phone, email, etc.), with clear form validation.
Contact Details Screen: Shows detailed information for a selected <br>contact with options to edit or delete the contact.
Buttons & Icons: Simple and recognizable icons for calling,<br> messaging, editing, and deleting contacts.
2. User Experience (UX Design):
Usability: Ensure easy navigation with a clean and intuitive <br>layout, making actions like adding and editing contacts quick and seamless.
Search Functionality: A top search bar that allows users to<br> quickly find a contact by name.
Responsiveness: Design the app to work smoothly across different<br. screen sizes (mobile, tablet, etc.).
Interaction Feedback: Subtle animations or feedback<br> (e.g., button highlights, form validation messages) for actions like saving a contact or deleting.
3. Additional Features:
Sort & Filter: Options to sort contacts alphabetically<br> or filter by categories (e.g., favorites).
Dark Mode: A toggle option for dark/light mode to <br>enhance user comfort.
This contact app clone project demonstrates proficiency in<br> applying UI/UX principles to create a user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing app while ensuring a smooth user experience for managing contacts.
